{"name":"Gozim, All Wikipedia on a Raspberry Pi","tagline":"A Go native implementation for ZIM files","body":"### Serve all Wikipedia from a small server\r\nGozim is a library and a toolset to achieve reasonable performance on small computers ([Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)), to serve a full Wikipedia set.    \r\nThink Internet outages, boats or countries without permanent Internet access, Gozim allows a classroom to work on Wikipedia from anywhere.  \r\n\r\n### How does it work ?\r\nThanks to Kiwix organisation, they provide [a full dump of all Wikipedia entries in different languages](http://download.kiwix.org/zim/) in a single file (around 40GB for english).  \r\nGozim is capable of reading that file and serve it via HTTP, even on very small servers.  \r\nWith a 25$ 64GB USB key and a 35$ [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), you get enough power to serve multiple users.  \r\nAs it serves regular web pages, it works with any WIFI/HTTP capable clients: [OLPC](http://one.laptop.org), cheap tablets, smartphones...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why not using the Kiwix tools ?\r\nKiwix goals are different, they provide a nice graphical client to browse ZIM files locally, but a file as big as 40GB does not target cheap PCs/tablets.  \r\nGozim is a server side tool providing web pages to cheap clients, install it somewhere and forget it.  \r\nIt was a way to improve my Go skills too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n* Download non indexed ZIM files (Gozim is using his own index system)\r\n* Start the web server with\r\n`gozimhttpd -path yourzimfile.zim` and launch a browser to http://yourip:8080\r\n* See [Gozim Github](http://github.com/akhenakh/gozim)\r\n","google":"UA-53376359-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
